<p>What is an app?</p>

<p> An app is computer software, or a program, most commonly a small, specific one used for mobile devices. The term app originally 
    referred to any mobile or desktop application, but as more app stores have emerged to sell mobile apps to smartphone and tablet 
    users, the term has evolved to refer to small programs that can be downloaded and installed all at once. There are thousands 
    of apps designed to run on today's smartphones and tablets. Some apps can be downloaded for free, while others must be purchased 
    from an app store.

<p>We prefer many laguages for app. But today we are going to learn about the mix of three laguages "Javascript" , "html" and "CSS".
    We will prefer expo for this app.
